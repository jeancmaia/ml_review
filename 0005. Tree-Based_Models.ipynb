    "Tree Based Methods are a family of ML models that have decision trees at their backbones. Decision Trees, on the other hand, are a kind of algorithm that looks like trees, where `branches` are conjunctions about covariates, holding decision rules `target-discriminative`. Leaves hold the decision process with target samples mapping."
