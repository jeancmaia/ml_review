    "\n",
    "K-Means algorithm aims to spot `n` distinct clusters on a dataset by minimizing the similarity intra-cluster. The loss function `inertia` uses the euclidean distance between points and protypes. As its default argument, K-Means finds circular clusters with the same variance, and can curb local minimums. As a result, the K-Means doesn't perform well on elongated and irregular shape, nor outliers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gaussian Mixture model takes gaussian distributions as learner backbone. `n` clusters formulated are gaussians centered in $\\mu$ and variance-covariance $\\Sigma$. Armed with a gaussian distribution, it is easy to optimize it by means of the Likelihood or its log; but for optimize `n` we leverage the `Expectation-Maximization` algorithm. \n",

    "\n",
    "From my perspective, it is one of the most interesting ML models for unsupervised learning that classical literature can provide. BIRCH stands for `Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies`, therefore it is a hierarchical model that leverage tree sorting algorithms to be computationally efficient. It works with the logic of Clustering Feature, and CF-Tree.\n"
